          <ul>
            <li><strong>1920s</strong> - In 1924, Sakichi Toyoda invented the Toyoda Model G Automatic Loom.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>1940s</strong> - From September 1947, Toyota's small-sized vehicles were sold under the name "Toyopet" (トヨペット).</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>1960s</strong> - By the early 1960s, the US had begun placing stiff import tariffs on certain vehicles.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>1980s</strong> - Toyota received its first Japanese Quality Control Award at the start of the 1980s and began <br>
               participating in a wide variety of motorsports.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>1990s</strong> - In the 1990s, Toyota began to branch out from producing mostly compact cars by adding many <br>

                (and later the Tundra), several lines of SUVs, a sport version of the Camry, known as the Camry Solara.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>2000s</strong> - In 2001, Toyota's Toyo Trust and Banking merged with two other banks to form UFJ Bank, which <br>
               was accused of corruption by Japan's government for making bad loans to alleged Yakuza crime <br>
                syndicates with executives accused of blocking Financial Service Agency inspections.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>2010s</strong> - In 2011, Toyota, along with large parts of the Japanese automotive industry, suffered from a series of natural disasters. </li>

               vehicles in the six months ending June 30, 2014, an increase of 3.8% on the same period the <br>
                previous year. Volkswagen AG, which recorded sales of 5.07 million vehicles, was close behind.[48]</li>
